# Cours-HTML5

⭐ Overview:

 I Created an HTML5 course in PDF format. This PDF is a basic HTML5 course I created by handwriting the content in my notebook and i tried photographing the pages with good quality. It includes 95% English and 5% Arabic explanations, covering introductory web concepts, URL structure, and essential HTML tags. I also included a separate file containing a practical HTML code application where I tried to apply most HTML tags. 

📌 Note:

 -You will find some photos blurry due to poor phone quality in photography.
 -I tried to do all the tags and the most important Tags.
